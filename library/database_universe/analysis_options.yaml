#     # This file configures the static analysis results for your project (errors,
# # warnings, and lints).
# #
# # This enables the 'recommended' set of lints from `package:lints`.
# # This set helps identify many issues that may lead to problems when running
# # or consuming Dart code, and enforces writing Dart using a single, idiomatic
# # style and format.
# #
# # If you want a smaller set of lints you can change this to specify
# # 'package:lints/core.yaml'. These are just the most critical lints
# # (the recommended set includes the core lints).
# # The core lints are also what is used by pub.dev for scoring packages.
